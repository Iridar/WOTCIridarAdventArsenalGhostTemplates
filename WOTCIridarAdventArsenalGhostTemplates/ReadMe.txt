[WOTC] Iridar's ADVENT Arsenal - Ghost Templates

This mod adds ghost templates of my ADVENT Weapon kitbashes so they can be used as skins for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2337161588][b]XSkin[/b][/url] or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1709345052][b] Weapon Skin Replacer[/b][/url] to replace visual appearance of other existing weapons.

[h1]LIST OF WEAPONS ADDED BY THIS MOD[/h1]
[list][*] ADVENT Battle Rifle - assault rifle
[*] ADVENT Plasma Rifle - assault rifle
[*] ADVENT Riot Shotgun - shotgun
[*] ADVENT Plasma Shotgun - shotgun
[*] ADVENT Long Lance - sniper rifle
[*] ADVENT Plasma Lance - sniper rifle
[*] ADVENT Sonic Rifle - assault rifle

[h1]REQUIREMENTS[/h1]

[b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2363075446][WOTC] Iridar's Template Master - Core[/url][/b] is required.

I have used a few assets from the [b]Tactical Legacy Pack DLC[/b]. Some of the weapons may not look properly if you don't have it.

Safe to add mid-campaign. WOTC-only, no vanilla version planned.

[h1]COMPANION MODS[/h1]

Ghost Templates by themselves do absolutely nothing, and you will require additional mods to use them.
[list][*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2337161588][b][WOTC] XSkin by Iridar[/b][/url] - will let you reskin other weapons you own into these Ghost Templates.
[*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2363084976][WOTC] Iridar's Template Master - Configuration[/url][/b] - one of these will let you integrate these Ghost Templates as actual usable weapons with their own stats.

[h1]KNOWN ISSUES[/h1]

Some parts of these new weapons will look too dark in the Photobooth.

These weapons are mostly intended to be used by ADVENT enemies, so they have very few visual weapon attachments set up.
